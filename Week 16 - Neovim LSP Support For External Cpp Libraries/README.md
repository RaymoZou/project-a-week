# Week 16 of Paw - Neovim Cpp LSP Support for External Libraries

This week's project of the week is going to take form in more of a guide. Recently, I've been interested in learning more about the SDL2 (Simple DirectMedia Layer) library that provides low level access to computer audio, user input and graphics - which is useful for creating games. The following guide assumes installation of Neovim and a couple of LSP related plugins.

## Requirements
- Neovim (configurable text editor fork of vi)
- nvim-lspconfig (lsp client)
- clangd (lsp language server for c/cpp)
