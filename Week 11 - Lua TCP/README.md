## Week 11 of Paw - Lua TCP Client & Server

This week's PAW is my attempt at a TCP client and server using Lua and the LuaSockets library. The client sends a "testing" string to the server which is printed
on the server side when the client closes.

## Modules Used
- [Luarocks](https://luarocks.org/) package manager
- [LuaSocket](https://luarocks.org/modules/lunarmodules/luasocket)
