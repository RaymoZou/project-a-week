# Week 12 of Paw - Raw Node Http Server

Plain ol' http server created using Node.js without external packages such as Express.js that abstract away a lot of the underlying logic. The purpose of this week's project is for me
to get a better understanding of how HTTP requests work under the hood (what headers are, status codes, http vs https, etc...).
